# Woolpy
A Unity Game for the Deep Space 8K in the ARS Electronica Center in Linz. Unfortunately not published. Team project with Martina Huber and Erik Thiele.


All the Code-Files that are in the Folder Assets/Scripts and in the subfolders are written by Romana Laister.
The Files FauxGravityAttractor.cs and FauxGravityBodies.cs in the Folder PlanetScripts were coded with the help of a tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHeQ8Hr92P4).
The other two team members did the Design Part and helped with debugging.
